The ASUW January Newsletter
Hey Huskies,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Jacob Feleke and I serve as the President of the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW). Some quick things about me, I’m a senior studying Political Science, founding member of the East African Student Association, and the Vice-President of the Kappa Lambda chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc., a historically Black Fraternity that is a part of the UW National Pan-Hellenic Council.
I'm reaching out today to welcome you back into the New Year and into week four.
On top of your studies, some of you may be following the current legislative session in Olympia. Rest assured that ASUW is lobbying for your interests, thanks to the hard work of our Legislative Liaison, Mirian Mj Mencias and the Office of Government Relations team (OGR). We are pushing for more mental health funding, financial aid reform, and other policies to improve the student experience. The two main bills currently being worked on are SB5999 and HB2242. More information on how to help support and submit testimonies can be found here. 
Huskies on the Hill is also here organized by the ASUW OGR!  Huskies on the Hill is the annual lobby day organized by OGR in which UW students are bussed to Olympia to meet with legislators and advocate for issues that impact our community! Sign up today!! 
Legislation with OGR Highlights
ASUW Student Senate also holds meetings to bring together a broad cross-section of the UW student community, which fosters a healthy dialogue surrounding issues affecting students. Senators introduce, deliberate, amend and vote on legislation, forming the official opinion of the UW student body. We empower students through the democratic process, providing a space where all voices can be heard.
Senate meets every Tuesday from 5 to 7pm in HUB 250 and on Zoom, and all meetings are open to the public. Feel free to stop by! If you’re interested in becoming an active senator and voting on legislation, please contact the Senate Membership Coordinator at asuwssmc@uw.edu. Any UW student is eligible either by gathering signatures or representing an RSO. For more information, please refer to senate.asuw.org.
Beyond advocacy, ASUW also provides funding and resources for registered student organizations (RSOs). We encourage you to get involved with an RSO aligned with your interests and background. Not only is it a great way to build community, but RSO participation can provide valuable skills and experience.
I also want to acknowledge the challenges many of you are facing and to let you know that ASUW is hereto support you. With midterms underway and the quarter ramping up, this can be a stressful time. Please know that these resources exist to help you.
The Counseling Center offers free and confidential services to support your mental health and wellbeing. UW Safe Campus also has advocates available to provide confidential support. And, as always, the ASUW 121 & 131 offices in the HUB are always open if you need guidance navigating campus life and resources.
Do not hesitate to reach out if you need support. Wishing you the best as you start and wrap up midterms and head into the remainder of Winter quarter.
