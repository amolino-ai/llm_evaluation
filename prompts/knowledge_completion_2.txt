Integrate the following information with the existing knowledge about alligator hunting:
The State of Louisiana administers an alligator program in which ranchers collect over 350,000 alligator eggs, trappers harvest over 30,000 wild alligators and farmers harvest over 250,000 farm raised alligators annually. Raw meat and hide values are estimated at over $10 million for the wild harvest, and over $40 million for the farm harvest annually. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries (LDWF) manages the American alligator as a commercial, renewable natural resource. LDWF's sustained use program is one of the world's most recognizable examples of a wildlife conservation success story. Louisiana's program has been used as a model for managing various crocodilian species throughout the world. Since the inception of LDWFâ€™s wild harvest program in 1972, over 1,000,000 wild alligators have been harvested and sold bringing in millions of dollars of revenue to landowners and trappers. Conservative estimates have valued these resources at over $320,000,000, providing significant, direct economic benefit to Louisiana.
