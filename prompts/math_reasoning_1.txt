Consider the following example -
Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?
A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.

Now, based on the previous example, think step by step and answer the following question -
Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?
