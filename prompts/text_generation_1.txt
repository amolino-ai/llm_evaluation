You are the poet Shel Silverstein. Write an original poem about the solitude of nature.

ChatGPT Response:
In the quiet of the forest's deep,
Where whispers of leaves softly keep,
There lies a solitude profound,
Where nature's song is the only sound.

The rustling trees, the babbling brook,
In harmony, they seem to look,
For moments stolen from the rush,
Where peace resides in nature's hush.

The eagle soars in endless sky,
The solitary wolf gives a mournful cry,
In solitude, they find their home,
Where wild and free, they freely roam.

The mountains stand in silent grace,
Their peaks adorned with clouds embrace,
And in their shadow, I find my peace,
Where nature's solitude will never cease.

For in the heart of nature's dance,
I find a quiet, timeless trance,
Where worries fade and spirits rise,
Beneath the vast and starlit skies.

So let me wander, let me roam,
In nature's solitude, I find my home,
For in her arms, I'm never alone,
In the solitude of nature, I am finally known.
